            <p>
              If you’re drowning in high interest credit card debt and struggling to keep up with minimum payments,
              Loanify can help you breathe again. Our program is a great choice for people with high levels of unsecured
              debt who are struggling with financial hardship, like a divorce or job loss. If you’re barely keeping up
              with your minimum payments and the balances on your accounts keep growing, then our program may be right
              for you. Why fight a losing battle against rising debt, when our debt relief services can help?

          </div>
          <div class="acc-body">
            <p>
              Debt settlement reduces your balance. Your debt is negotiated down, and you pay less than you owe. The
              creditor forgives the remaining balance in a transaction called a settlement.

              Our program is easy to understand. Rather than paying your creditors, you’ll deposit a monthly payment to
              a Dedicated Savings Account, in your name and under your control. As funds build up, we’ll contact your
              creditors to negotiate and agree upon reduced balances. Because you’re no longer paying the creditor, they
              will likely view getting a reduced amount as better than risking no payment at all. Then, you’ll authorize
              us to use the funds in your Dedicated Savings Account to pay your creditors the lower, negotiated amounts.

          serious financial issues may want to ask for professional financial advice or take into account other
          alternatives.<br><br>This website does not lend funds to customers. loanify.ai does not lend the money
          requested by customers and does not make any decisions regarding the loan applications. loanify.ai is neither
          a lending partner nor a lender. loanify.ai brings together potential customers with lenders and lending
          partners from a network of approved lending brands. loanify.ai has no control and takes no responsibility for
          any actions or inactions of any of the lenders or lending partners. loanify.ai neither operates as a broker,
          agent or representative of any lending brand nor endorses any of the lenders or lending partners. loanify.ai
          gets commission by lenders and lending partners, usually based on a ping-tree model like Google AdWords where
          the highest bidder is referred to the potential customer. In any case, all of the loanify.ai services are
          always free of charge for consumers. In certain scenarios, consumers may get the option to apply for a loan at
          a tribal lender. You should know that tribal and some federal laws apply to such tribal lenders, whereas state
          laws and usury caps do not. Please, be aware that the rates of tribal lenders may be higher than the rates of
          state lenders. Furthermore, you may be asked to agree on resolving any possible disputes in a tribal
          jurisdiction. It is crucial for you to fully read and understand the terms and conditions of any loan provided
          to you by any lender, both state and tribal. In case you are not able to repay the loan offered to you or you
          determine that the loan terms are not suitable for you, you are urged to decline that particular loan
          offer.<br><br>The services of loanify.ai are not available in all states. You will not get any loan offers or
          be connected to any lenders or lending partners in a case you search for a loan in a state where such loans
          are banned or in a state where loanify.ai does not have a reliable lender or lending partner. Please, make
          sure to both read and understand the terms and conditions of any loan offer provided by lenders or lending
          partners. In case you are not able to repay the loan offered to you or you determine that the loan terms are
          not suitable for you, you are urged to decline that particular loan offer.<br><br>By submitting your
          information via this website, you are authorizing loanify.ai and its partners to do a credit check, which may
          include verifying your social security number, driver license number or other identification, and a review of
          your creditworthiness, and to continue to monitor you credit status via additional credit checks or other
          methods. Credit checks are usually performed by one of the major credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax and
          TransUnion, but also may include alternative credit bureaus such as Teletrack, DP Bureau or others. All the
          above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be
          shared with any third parties.<br><br>Disclosure of Terms and Conditions of Lenders or Lending
          Partners<br><br>Lenders and lending partners are responsible for providing customers with documents where they
          can find all the details regarding rates and fees related to the loan offer presented to them, including any
          potential charges for late payments as well as terms that may allow you (if the law allows it) to renew,
          rollover or refinance your loan. Please note that any fees and interest rates related to the loans are
          determined by the lenders or lending partners and they are based on the internal policies of the lenders or
          lending partners, applicable laws and underwriting criteria. Consequently, loanify.ai has no control or
          knowledge of any loan terms and conditions offered by the lenders or lending partners in our network. Please,
          make sure to both read and understand the terms and conditions of any loan offer provided by lenders or
          lending partners. In case you are not able to repay the loan offered to you or you determine that the loan
          terms are not suitable for you, you are urged to decline that particular loan offer.<br><br>Late Payments
          Negatively Affect Your Credit Score<br><br>We want to make it clear to our customers that late payments and
          skipping payments can hurt your credit score. To avoid damaging your credit history, please apply for loans
          with terms you can repay on time. In case you are not able to cover a payment in due time, make sure to
          immediately contact your lender or lending partner in order to discuss the best course of action.</p>
