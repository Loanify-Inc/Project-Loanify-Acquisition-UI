You should know that tribal and some federal laws apply to such tribal lenders, whereas state laws and usury caps do not. Please, be aware that the rates of tribal lenders may be higher than the rates of state lenders. Furthermore, you may be asked to agree on resolving any possible disputes in a tribal jurisdiction. It is crucial for you to fully read and understand the terms and conditions of any loan provided to you by any lender, both state and tribal.
